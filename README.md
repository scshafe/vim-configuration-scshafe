# vim-configuration-scshafe

I use this repository to  easily sync my personal neovim and vim settings across computers, VM's and WSL distros.

Clone this folder and run `setup-vim-configuration.sh` to set these settings. (note: this will overwrite current settings)

```
$ setup-vim-configurations.sh
```

To save changes and push them to the repo run:

```
$ save-vim-configurations.sh
```
